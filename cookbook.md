The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. </br>

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. </br>

For each record it is provided:</br>

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. </br>
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. </br>
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. </br>
- Its activity label. </br>
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</br>

The dataset includes the following files: </br>

- 'README.txt'</br>
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.</br>
- 'features.txt': List of all features.</br>
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.</br>
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.</br>
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.</br>
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.</br>
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.</br></br>

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. </br>

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. </br>

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. </br>

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. </br>

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. </br>

Notes: </br>
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]. </br>
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file. </br>

##Feature Selection </br>

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </br>

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).  </br>

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).  </br>

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:   </br>
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.  </br>

tGravityAcc-XYZ </br>
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ </br>
tBodyGyro-XYZ </br>
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ </br>
tBodyAccMag </br>
tGravityAccMag </br>
tBodyAccJerkMag </br>
tBodyGyroMag </br>
tBodyGyroJerkMag </br>

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ </br>
fBodyGyro-XYZ </br>
fBodyAccMag </br>
fBodyAccJerkMag </br>
fBodyGyroMag </br>

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:  </br>

max(): Largest value in array </br>
min(): Smallest value in array </br>

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.  </br>
iqr(): Interquartile range  </br> 
entropy(): Signal entropy  </br>
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4 </br>
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals </br>
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude </br>
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency </br>
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal  </br>
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal  </br>
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window. </br>
angle(): Angle between to vectors. </br>

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable: </br>

gravityMean </br>
